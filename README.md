# gpx-coords-tool

For a [school project](https://github.com/projetDansLaMontagne) with teamates, we are working with gpx files of hicking trails and the user location. If the user notices something of interest (a fallen tree, a nice viewpoint, ...) he can add a marker on the map. The goal of those tools are:

 - [x] To find common coordinates between the gpx files in order to add the markers on each needed gpx files.
 - [ ] To find the closest point of the user location on the gpx file in order to add the marker on the closest gpx file. 1/2
   - [x] Function that finds the x closest points of a given point on a gpx file.
   - [ ] Function that adds the marker between the 2 closest points of a given point on a gpx file.
